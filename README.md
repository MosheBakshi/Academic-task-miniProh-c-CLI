###### **Academic task written with C language on VS19 as CLI**

__Ex1:__
	* > returning pointer to n sized unsigned int array dynamiclly allocated in the function. 
	* > each cell contains '2' powered by index module 32.
__Ex2:__
	* > multipling two static matrix into new one dynamic matrix and returning its address. 
__Ex3:__
	* > recieving dynamic matrix and finding the matrix cells which contains number equals to raw+col. 
	* > the function creates a linked list which every node array contains the cordinates and the cell value. 
	* > the function returns the size of the list and returning by reference the the array and the list. 
__Ex4:__
	* > recieving list of unsigned int values and creating new list of the odds numbers in same positions.
	* > as the original list.
	* > the function returns a pointer of the new list.
	* > the pointer of the original list can be changed if the pointer has removed and the origin also can be empty or just odd/even.
__Ex5:__
	* > like Ex4, but without creating new list.
	* > the function will relink the items on the original list and spliit the original into two different lists of odd/even.
