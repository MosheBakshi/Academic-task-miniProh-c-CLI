0.__Ex2:__2
	2.> multipling two static matrix into new one dynamic matrix and returning its address. 1
0.__Ex3:__3
	3.> recieving dynamic matrix and finding the matrix cells which contains number equals to raw+col. 1

	3.> the function returns the size of the list and returning by reference the the array and the list. 3
0.__Ex4:__4
	4.> recieving list of unsigned int values and creating new list of the odds numbers in same positions. 1
	4.> as the original list. 2
	4.> the function returns a pointer of the new list. 3
