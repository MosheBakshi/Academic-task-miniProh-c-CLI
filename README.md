## Matrix & Linked list

###### **Academic task written with C language on VS19 as CLI**

__Ex1:__<br/>

	> returning pointer to n sized unsigned int array dynamiclly allocated in the function. <br/>
	> each cell contains '2' powered by index module 32.<br/>
__Ex2:__<br/>

	> multipling two static matrix into new one dynamic matrix and returning its address. <br/>
__Ex3:__<br/>

	> recieving dynamic matrix and finding the matrix cells which contains number equals to raw+col.<br/>
	> the function creates a linked list which every node array contains the cordinates and the cell value.<br/>
	> the function returns the size of the list and returning by reference the the array and the list.<br/>
__Ex4:__<br/>

	> recieving list of unsigned int values and creating new list of the odds numbers in same positions.<br/>
	> as the original list.<br/>
	> the function returns a pointer of the new list.<br/>
	> the pointer of the original list can be changed if the pointer has removed and the origin also can be empty or just odd/even.<br/>
__Ex5:__<br/>

	> like Ex4, but without creating new list.<br/>
	> the function will relink the items on the original list and spliit the original into two different lists of odd/even.<br/>
